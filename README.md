## 📸 Features

- 🎯 Real-time motion detection
- 🕹️ Built using Pygame for GUI and event control
- 🔔 Alert mechanism on motion detection
- ✅ Clean project structure with virtual environment support
- 🛠️ Easy to set up and extend

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Libraries:** `pygame`
- *(Extendable with OpenCV, email alerts, camera input, etc.)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment

---

### 🖥️ Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sukheshgupta/ALERT-GUARD-MOTION-DETECTION.git
cd ALERT-GUARD-MOTION-DETECTION

# 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install pygame


▶️ Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
python MotionDetection.py
A Pygame window will open and begin the motion detection simulation.

Follow on-screen prompts or alerts if included.
